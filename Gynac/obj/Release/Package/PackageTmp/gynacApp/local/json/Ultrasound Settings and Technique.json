  "des1": "Good quality imaging is the basis of a good quality scan, whereby a correct diagnosis can be arrived at. Obtaining good images requires provision of correct settings on the scanner, as also the knowledge of how to modify these settings in each individual case, based on the patient’s characteristics, organs to be examined and the information required. This can be done only if we are familiar with the settings available on the scanner.",
  "des2": "This presentation provides information about the basic features and adjustments possible on the scanner and how these could be modified to the investigator’s best advantage. It includes the settings required for a good quality B mode (2D ultrasound) image, as also for colour, power and spectral Doppler. Minimum required physics of ultrasound have also been included.",
