  "des1": "This presentation deals with the monitoring of menstrual cycles in patients undergoing fertility treatment. It discusses the role of advanced ultrasound technologies like Doppler and 3D ultrasound for the diagnosis of low reserve, poor responders and polycystic ovarian syndrome. It also helps to decide the optimal stimulation protocols, to minimize cycle cancellations due to poor response, hyper-response or OHSS",
  "des2": "Evaluating the follicle and the endometrium in the preovulatory phase by Doppler and 3D ultrasound can provide a more precise assessment of their functional maturity and can be effective in improving the results of Assisted Reproductive Technologies. Luteal phase assessment gives an insight into the causes of failure of treatment, thus enabling required changes in subsequent cycles. The Doppler findings of the ovary, follicle, uterus and endometrium can be correlated with the hormonal status of the patient during natural and induced cycles, thereby avoiding the need for frequent hormonal assessments.",
